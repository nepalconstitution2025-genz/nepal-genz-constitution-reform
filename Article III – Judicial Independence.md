### Section 2. Collegium System of Governance

1. Courts of higher jurisdiction, including the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court, shall be governed by a **Collegium of senior judges**, not by single individuals.
2. The Collegium shall decide on judicial appointments, transfers, and disciplinary matters through majority vote.
3. No judge, including the Chief Justice, shall exercise unilateral powers over appointments, case assignments, or disciplinary proceedings.
4. This system ensures **collective responsibility** and prevents concentration of authority in a single office.

### Section 6. Doctrine of Democratic Pillar

1. Judicial Independence shall be regarded as a **non-negotiable pillar of democracy**, equally essential as the Legislature and Executive.
    
2. Like the Swiss model of **direct democracy**, citizens shall play an oversight role in the Judiciary through representation in appointment commissions, access to public hearings, and referendum safeguards where constitutional amendments affect judicial independence.
    
3. Any attempt by the Executive or Legislature to interfere with the Judiciary shall be treated as a **constitutional violation and an attack on democracy itself**.
